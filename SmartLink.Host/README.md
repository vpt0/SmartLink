# SmartLink.Host

## Description
**SmartLink.Host** is a Windows-based desktop application that enables selective sharing of system resources—such as RAM, CPU, and storage—between connected devices over a secure local or peer-to-peer network. It allows a host system to detect available hardware resources and share them through an auto-generated, accessible web link, making resource sharing seamless, controlled, and user-friendly.

The purpose of SmartLink is to create a lightweight, decentralized alternative to virtual machines or cloud compute services—empowering students, developers, and small teams to collaborate and scale without heavy infrastructure.

## Features
- ?? **System Resource Detection**: Automatically detects the host system's hardware specs (CPU, RAM, Storage) and shows real-time availability.
- ?? **Controlled Resource Sharing**: Lets the host user define exactly how much of each resource to share, ensuring system stability.
- ?? **Auto-Generated Shareable Link**: Generates a unique web link for guests to access shared resources with one click—no complex setup required.
- ?? **Live Usage Monitoring** *(in development)*: Provides visual feedback on resource utilization to both host and guest.
- ?? **Secure Peer-to-Peer Connection** *(planned)*: Enables encrypted and authenticated access to ensure privacy and protection.
- ?? **Modular Architecture**: Built to be scalable, allowing future expansion to GPU sharing, AI-based optimization, and more.
